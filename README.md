This is a simple webview app that leads to [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/).

Open Classrooms is a great portal for learning online and this app should be helpful to those who prefer that the site have its own 'personal space', instead of opening it up in a browser all the time.

While the **official** android version of the app from OpenClassrooms is yet to be released, this version should suffice for personal use. 


## How To Install
1. Open this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gSY1MTZMYxchHpsTxzWmc-xAFHsQRpDF) in your browser.
